For the serious note takers there are few apps that surpass [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). While it uses markdown like most other note taking apps, it also features a special linking system to other nodes. For instance I can create a link to [[Home\|Home]] as well as [[Orbiter\|Orbiter]] and it will show up on both of those notes.
